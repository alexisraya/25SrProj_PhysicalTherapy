## üîç Code Quality Tools

To maintain code consistency across our team of contributors, this project uses ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks.

### Setup

When you clone the repository and run `npm install`, the pre-commit hooks will be automatically set up through Husky.

### Available Commands

- `npm run lint` - Check your code for linting issues
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix linting issues
- `npm run format` - Format all code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `npm run lint:check` - Run both linting and format checks
- `npm run lint:fix-all` - Fix all linting and formatting issues

### Pre-commit Validation

A pre-commit hook is configured to automatically:

- Lint your JavaScript, TypeScript, and Svelte files
- Format your code with Prettier
- Prevent committing code that doesn't meet our standards

This ensures that all code in the repository maintains consistent style and quality.

### Editor Integration

For the best development experience, we recommend installing ESLint and Prettier extensions for your code editor:

- VS Code:
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

A `.vscode/settings.json` file is included in the repository with pre-configured settings to:

- Automatically format files on save
- Set Prettier as the default formatter
- Enable ESLint auto-fix on save
- Configure language-specific formatting options

These settings ensure consistent editor behavior for all contributors without requiring manual setup.

### Configuration Files

- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration (flat config format)
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Files to exclude from Prettier formatting
- `lint-staged.config.js` - Configuration for pre-commit checks

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Link related issues (if applicable)
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Describe what was changed
- List any new dependencies
- Mention any breaking changes
- Test your changes
- Check that your branch is up to date with main

## üåê Deployment

This project is deployed on Vercel. Each push to the main branch triggers an automatic deployment.

### Production Environment

- Production URL: https://mend.vercel.app/
- Production Branch: main

### Preview Environments

- Every pull request gets a unique preview deployment
- Preview URLs are automatically posted in PR comments
- Great for testing changes before merging to main

> **Note**: Make sure to check the deployment status and preview URLs before merging PRs.
